# CartPole Game with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
Welcome to the CartPole Game repository! Here, we explore the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to train an agent to play the classic CartPole game. RL algorithms, particularly the Deep Q-Network (DQN), are utilized to train the agent to balance a pole on a moving cart. Additionally, we plan to implement further optimizations using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to enhance the agent's performance.

## Description
The CartPole game is a classical problem in the field of RL, where the objective is to balance a pole that is attached to a cart moving along a track. The agent controls the movement of the cart to prevent the pole from falling over. RL algorithms learn to maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with the environment, making decisions based on observed states, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.

## Algorithms Used
### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
DQN is a type of RL algorithm that employs a neural network, known as the Q-network, to approximate the Q-function, which measures the expected future rewards for each action in a given state. By training the Q-network to minimize the difference between predicted and actual Q-values, the agent learns to make optimal decisions over time.

### Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)
DDQN is an extension of the DQN algorithm aimed at addressing the issue of overestimation bias present in traditional Q-learning methods. By decoupling action selection and value estimation, DDQN improves the stability and performance of the Q-learning process, leading to more efficient and reliable learning.
